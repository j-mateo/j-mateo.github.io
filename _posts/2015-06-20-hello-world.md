I've always wanted to have a blog. There have been so many times when I thought to myself, "If I had a blog, I would totally blog this." But I felt like it would be very time consuming to keep up with it along with work, family, and education.

I think it's time that I start sharing the little knowledge I have with the world. So starting this week, I will be posting any snippet of code that might be beneficial to other developers as well as Android tutorials to help others learn the framework.
